## ðŸš€ Getting Started: The 'initiate' Command

To begin using this guide system, simply type:

```
initiate
```

When you type `initiate`, Copilot will present you with a simple menu:

1. **Start a new app project (step-by-step)**
	- Begin the guided workflow from concept to launch.
2. **Resume a previous project**
	- Pick up where you left off using your saved progress.
3. **View quickstart guide**
	- See a one-page summary of how the system works.
4. **Learn about methodologies & best practices**
	- Explore Agile, Scrum, and other approaches to choose your workflow style.

Each option comes with a short explanation, so you always know what to do next. This makes onboarding fast and user friendlyâ€”no need to browse folders or guess where to start.

**Note:** For a full list and explanation of software development methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, Lean, DevOps, etc.), see [`copilot_brain/methodologies_and_best_practices.md`](copilot_brain/methodologies_and_best_practices.md). This resource helps you choose the best workflow for your project and understand how industry standards apply to your process.

## ðŸš¦ How to Start or Change the Milestone Goal

To activate or update progress tracking, simply type:

```
New goal
```


After you submit `New goal`, Copilot will prompt you to enter your goal description.

**Example Workflow:**
1. You: `New goal`
2. Copilot: "What is your new milestone goal?"
3. You: `Guide system is capable of building Facebook-level complex apps`

**Recommendation:**  
It is recommended to use **ask mode** while discussing and refining your milestone goal with Copilot. Once you are satisfied with the goal and ready to begin building, switch to **agent mode** to execute and track progress.

When you set a new Milestone Goal, Copilot will:
- Initialize or update the progress tracker
- List all required tasks
- Track your progress as you complete each task

If you set a new Milestone Goal while one is in progress, Copilot will ask for confirmation before resetting your progress.
