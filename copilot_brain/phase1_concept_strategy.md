# Phase 1 – Concept & Strategy (For Everyone)

**Note:** For a full list and explanation of software development methods (like Agile or Scrum), see [`copilot_brain/methodologies_and_best_practices.md`](methodologies_and_best_practices.md).

## How This Step Works

**What Copilot will do automatically:**
- Copilot can create all the main documents for this phase for you, using best practices and your previous answers.

**What you need to do:**
- If you want to provide your own ideas (for example, your own mission statement or research), just paste them in when asked. Copilot will use your input instead of generating its own.
- If you don’t have anything to add, just say “continue” and Copilot will do the rest.

**Tip:** Copilot will always ask before overwriting anything you’ve written.

## What You’ll Create in This Step
You’ll end up with these files (don’t worry, Copilot will save them in the right place):
- mission.md
- target_audience.md
- pain_points.md
- value_proposition.md
- competitor_review.md
- monetization.md
- growth.md
- concept_brief.md

This phase is about figuring out what your app is, why it matters, and who it’s for. You don’t need to know any technical terms—just answer questions in your own words, or let Copilot do it for you.

## Step 1 – What is your app’s mission?

**What Copilot will do automatically:**

**Example:**
> “Create more authentic connections online that can translate into real life.”

## Step 2 – Who is your app for?

**What Copilot will do automatically:**
- Copilot can describe your target audience based on your app idea.

**What you need to do:**
