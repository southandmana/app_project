# Phase 5 – Copilot Launches and Grows Your App (For Everyone)

**Note:** For a full list and explanation of software development methods (like Agile or Scrum), see [`copilot_brain/methodologies_and_best_practices.md`](methodologies_and_best_practices.md).

## How This Step Works

**What Copilot will do automatically:**
- Copilot will generate launch materials, marketing plans, and growth strategies for your app.
- Copilot will handle all technical details unless you want to provide your own materials or ideas.

**What you need to do:**
- If you have your own branding, marketing, or other materials, you can upload or describe them when asked.
- If not, just say “continue” and Copilot will do everything for you.

**Tip:** Copilot will always ask before overwriting anything you’ve provided.

## What You’ll Create in This Step
You’ll end up with these files (Copilot will save them in the right place):
- appstore_metadata.md
- marketing_funnel.md
- monetization.md
- retention_systems.md
- trust_safety.md

This phase is about letting Copilot help you launch and grow your app. You don’t need to know any technical terms—just answer questions in your own words, or let Copilot do it all.
